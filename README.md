# Optimizing Coffee Sales for a Chain Store: A Machine Learning Approach

Introduction:
This report analyzes the sales data of a coffee chain store to optimize coffee sales using machine learning. The dataset used contains various sales variables such as time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions, as well as the target variable, the total number of coffee sales per day.

Findings:
We evaluated the performance of three different machine learning algorithms: linear regression, decision tree, and random forest. The random forest algorithm had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and highest R-squared value, indicating the best performance in predicting coffee sales. The decision tree algorithm had the second-best performance, while linear regression had higher MAE and lower R-squared values.

Conclusion:
The results suggest that the random forest algorithm may be the best choice for optimizing coffee sales for a chain store using machine learning. Further analysis could be conducted to optimize the model, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. This could improve its performance and provide more accurate coffee sales predictions, which could be valuable for the coffee chain store to optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.
